<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p align="justify">In today's digital age, accessibility and user experience play a pivotal role in ensuring that technology is inclusive for all individuals. However, a significant barrier exists for those who rely on text-based information but may face challenges in reading or comprehending written content. This includes individuals with visual impairments, learning disabilities, or those engaged in multitasking scenarios where reading is impractical.</p>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p align="justify">Imagine if you couldn't easily read things on your computer or phone, either because of vision problems or because you're busy doing something else. Many people face this challenge every day. Our project aims to solve this by creating a simple tool that turns written text into spoken words. This way, everyone, including those with difficulties reading or people on the go, can easily understand and access information. We want to make technology more friendly and useful for everyone.</p><br>
